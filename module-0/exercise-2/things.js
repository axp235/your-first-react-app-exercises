//  a class in ES is not like you'd think of a class in C# or Java.
//  It is "syntactical sugar" - this class gets turned into a normal ES object.
//  We won't talk much about the differences between this and C#/Java,
//   for now just know that this thing will mostly act like you'd expect
//   a class to act in your code.
